			 <p>I use Adobe XD regularly for my full-time job, while Figma is my go-to for personal projects. Consequently, I&rsquo;m eternally oscillating between these two apps on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Having spent the whole day on Adobe XD, transitioning to Figma is somewhat peculiar due to the contrasting scrolling direction for zoom-in and zoom-out operations. Although neither direction seems inherently correct or incorrect, for some reason, Figma&rsquo;s method appears more intuitive to me.</p>
<p>However, after a <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/adobe-xd-discussions/mouse-zooming-scroll-direction-is-reversed/td-p/11513112">much extensive search</a> for a solution, it was disheartening to discover that neither of the applications offers the option to customize the zoom scrolling direction. The sole work-around I could find was to alternately enable or disable the scrolling direction on my Mac.</p>

<p>But going to &ldquo;Preferences &gt; Mouse settings&rdquo; every time I needed to make the switch was a tedious process.</p>
<p>While wishing there was a quicker way to switch the mouse scrolling direction on my mac, I did some research and I found a tool called: <a href="https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnnaturalScrollWheels</a> which exists as a solution for those who want to set the natural scrolling direction on the trackpad while maintaining the regular scrolling direction on the mouse. (Because for some reason, when toggling the &ldquo;Scroll direction: Natural&rdquo; option on a mac, it also changes the Trackpad scrolling direction).</p>
<p>With this tool installed, now I simply click the icon on the menu bar &gt; Preferences and check or uncheck the invert vertical scrolling every time I switch from AdobeXD to Figma.</p>

<p>I hope this is found useful for those UX designers, who like me, are constantly using both apps.</p>
